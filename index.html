  <h1>no party calgary</h1>
  <p>Well, our provincial overlords decided that Calgary should have political parties at the municipal level. Nobody asked for it, but here it is.</p>

  <p>There are already some parties out there. We get it. We hope the canapes are good and someone is paying attention to the music choice.</p>
    
  <p>But not everyone parties. Honestly, we don't get out much either. That's why no party calgary wants to give folks a chance to feel included.</p>
    
  <p>So here's what we'll do: If you're running in the 2025 Calgary election and you don't have a party, we'll treat you like you're in one. Out of respect.</p>

  <h2>is no party calgary a party in calgary?</h2>

  <p>Well, we like to think we have a good time. But no, there is no no calgary party party. At least for legal purposes.</p>
  
  <h2>will no party endorse candidates?</h2>

  <p>Well of course parties are going to endorse their candidates silly.

  <p>Oh, you mean are we? Well we haven't decided that yet.</p> 
    
  <p>But you should definitely not vote for Sean Chu. He's done some <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/sean-chu-calgary-councillor-police-act-charges-1.6212651">pretty awful stuff</a>.</p>
